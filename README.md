## Tweaked raid basim
Updated version of Henke's BaSim which gives healers more functionality. Defender and collector can both take aggro. Most of their movement and aggro mechanics are correct as far as I can tell. I don't know if healers have residual pathing on runners or not. Feel free to DM me if you see something that's wrong in this sim.
